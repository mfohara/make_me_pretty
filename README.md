HTML based workshop for beginners. "Code me like on of your french webpages."
Week one, day one. Its time to code!!!!!

## Objectives
In this lesson we will be going over the basics of HTML and CSS. By the end of this lesson you should have a somewhat solid understanding of what both languages are used for and why they are so important.

## HTML
HTML also known as the hyper-text markdown language is a language to describe web documents. In html there are these items called tags that describe how a webpage can look and behave. We use these tags in ways that we are able to present information to our user.

# CSS
CSS also known as Cascading Style Sheets is used in tandem with HTML to control what your content looks like. CSS is to HTML as Cookies is to milk. If you had to compare the two CSS would be one of the language that would require a little more thinking power. A little clip art to show you what I mean.

At the same time however it is one of the most fun languages that people can fool around with in terms of styling content on the web.

## Lesson 01:

Your first task for the day is to recreate the webpage provided in a png file in the lessons/assignments folder `assignment_001.png` and the `lesson_001.md`. Use a good work flow. One good workflow is to have whatever code editor you have, create a 2 pane window and have one side be the html and the other the css. Keep the png file in reference as you go along in another window.

Good luck and have fun.
